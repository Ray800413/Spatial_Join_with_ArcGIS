    "This jupyter notebook is the training tutorial for the use of the `Spatial Join` tool. This training tutorial assumes you already have the intermediate level of knowledge of the **_Spatial Join_** and the basic understanding of **_FieldMaps_**. It also assumes that you are familiar with other geospatial tools, such as the `Select Layers by Attribute` and `Clip` tool. In order to complete this training tutorial smoothly, except for the skills of using `Arcpy` scripts, you should have basic understanding of the libaries coming along with `Python`, such as `pandas` and `regex`, as well.\n",

    "For this tutorial, we will use two data: **(1) Car accident data in Minnesota in 2016 (named \"mn-2016-acc.csv\") (2) Minnesota County shapefile (named \"County_Boundaries_in_Minnesota\" in \"shp_bdry_counties\" folder)** to answer some statistical questions such as identify which county has the highest fatal number caused by accidents and what type of accident most frequently occured in each county."
